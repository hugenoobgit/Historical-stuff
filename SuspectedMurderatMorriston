Suspected Murder at Morriston. 
Mysterious Disappearance of a Girl. 
The Body Found in the Canal. 
At the Midland Hotel, Morriston, on Tuesday evening, Mr Edward Strick, the county coroner, held an inquiry into the circumstances attending the death of Hannah Rosser, a young woman, whose body was found in the canal, near Ynysforgan Bridge, a day or two ago.—The first witness examined was Maria Griffiths, wife of Richard Griffiths, Neath-road, Llansamlet. She identified the body as that of her sister, who was 18 years of age, and who was recently a domestic servant in the employ of Mr Eastman, fruiterer, Castle street, Swansea. On Monday, 31st October, deceased came home, having had a fit. Deceased went into the town the same evening, and, having purchased a dolman and hat, returned shortly after ten o'clock apparently in her usual health and spirits. When not in service deceased lived at home with her parents, with whom she was on good terms. She went out on the following Thursday (November 3rd), with the intention of going to town, but she did not return, and had not been seen alive since that time. She was keeping company with a young man named J. Williams, who lived in Dillwyn-street, Morriston, and in whose company she was seen on the I previous Sunday. Witness first heard of her sister's death on Monday morning last.—Elizabeth Walters, house-keeper to Mr Eastman, said deceased came there on a months trial as a general servant. She had a fit about a fortnight after coming there, remaining in it about half-an-hour. At the end of the month deceased left. Witness had not seen her since.-Dr Edward Rice Morgan, Morriston, said, in accordance with instructions, he had examined the body, which had evidently been in the water several days. On examining the right side of the head, he found a clean cut wound extending from the right ear inwards and through the bone and into the eye ball, horizontally. It showed evidence of having being caused by great force being used. Above that, on the forehead, on the same side, there was a clean cut an inch long, and another about three inches long at the junction of the hair with the forehead in the bone. At right angles to that. in the centre of the forehead was a clean cut from two to three inches long, On the top of the head was a fearful wound extending through the skull and the bone to the brain. The cut was a clean cut and was about four inches in length, and the brain was exposed. At the back of the head were two more cuts, which extended down to the bone, and which were from two to three inches long. There were no marks of bruises on the body, and the cuts must have been caused by a sharp iustrument, used with much force. In his opinion the wounds could not have been caused by barges proceeding up and down the canal, and there were no marks on the body to indicate that it had been in any way injured by barges. The wounds were not such as could have been self-inflicted, and the fact that deceased had gloves on, which were unbroken, seemed to denote that no violent struggle had taken place, or the gloves would have been torn.—David Williams, Ynismedw, said that whilst bringing a barge of shearing up the canal from the tin works, his attention was drawn by a man in the barge to a body in the water just above Ynisforgan Bridge. He immediately took the boat-hook, and brought it to the embankment, when it was shortly afterwards taken charge of by P.C. Evans.-The Coroner said the case was one which threw grave suspicion on somebody. When he ordered the doctor to make an examination he was not prepared for the evidence which they had heard that day. The case was one which should be thoroughly investigated, and he would adjourn the inquiry.
