TRAFFIC IN BIRDS' SKINS 
The Bill to restrict the importation of birds' skins for millinery purposes, which has been introduced in Parliament, will be supported in the Commons by Mr. Sydney Buxton and in the Lords by Lord Avebury. There is an enormous traffic in this class of merchandise, and at one sale not long ago in London there changed hands:- 416 packages of osprey feathers; 156 cases of peacocks' feathers; 3,979 birds of Paradise; 342 small birds; 3,766 crested pigeons; 1,876 Impeyan pheasants; 546 Argus pheasants. The object of the Bill is to put a stop to this wholesale traffic, which is leading to the extinction of several beautiful Species of birds.
