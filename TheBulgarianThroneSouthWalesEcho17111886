The Bulgarian Throne, 
RUSSIAN PLOTTING. 
The Morning Post Vienna correspondent has it on the best authority that the Prince of Mingrelia is not the candidate whom the Czar and the Russian Government are anxious to see on the Bulgarian Throne, but is put forward, on account of his complete unfitness for the post, to pave the way for another candidate, whose name I am not authorised to divulge. 
Commenting on the Bulgarian difficulty the Times says :â€”The situation presents no insoluble difficulties. Russia, after all, has only to adhere to her own repeated pledges in order to withdraw herself from an untenable position. There is no desire in any quarter to deny that her labours and sacrifices in the war with Turkey have given her a peculiar claim to moral influence with the Bulgarian people, but that claim does not depend upon law. It is rooted only in sentiment it cannot be embodied in a treaty or statute, and it rests mainly with the Government of the Czar to destroy or to preserve it. A Conference Proposal. 
The Chronicle Vienna correspondent learns on good authority that a proposal will be put forward, within the next few days, for assembling a conference of Ambassadors with a view to settle the question of the two Bulgarias.
