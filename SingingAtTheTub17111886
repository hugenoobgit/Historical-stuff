SINGING AT THE TUB. 
In the Bromley County Court.- before, Judge Homersham Cox—Jessie Keen, a laundrymaid, sued the proprietor of a laundry, a man named Luck, her late employer, for three weeks'. wages. The plaintiff said she gave Mr Luck a week's notice, but left in consequence of his threats against her. She was singing at her tub, when her master came up, and ordered her to desist. She declined to do so, where upon he swore at her. She gave him notice, and he then threatened to kick her out, "whether she liked it or lumped it." He treated all the girls in his employ in the same manner. In answer to the Judge she said that singing at the tub was her only offence. -His Honour: Perhaps you sing out of tune, which would be unbearable to a person with a sensitive ear. (Laughter.)—A maid employed at the laundry, having given corroborative evidence, defendant called two other women in his service, who stated that he had given orders that the maids should not sing at their work. The plaintiff persistently disregarded the order, and the defendant said that she must leave, but he did not threaten or swear at her.—The Judge said he did not believe that threatening language had been used, and gave judgment for the defendant, who, he observed, must be supported in his efforts to keep order in his laundry.
