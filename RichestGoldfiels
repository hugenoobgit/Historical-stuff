WORLD'S RICHEST GOLDFIELDS 
Some five weeks ago three mining speculators tried their luck in the Nevada Hills, less than 300 miles from San Francisco. Fifty miles from Reno the prospectors discovered a wealthy deposit of gold at the junction of two hills. At a neighbouring village they told of their good luck and 200 railroad labourers dropped their tools and then commenced the mad rush for the new goldfield, which was christened "Rawhide." Now Rawhide has a population of 10,000, and 200 a day are arriving. A fortnight back a man bought a lot for £1,600, and now will not sell for £ 5,000. some of the ore yields as much as £800 a ton. Veteran goldseekers from all parts of the world declare Rawhide has eclipsed all records for gold discoveries.
