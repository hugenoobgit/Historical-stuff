MONEY MATTERS. 
Gold coin (a writer in Spare Moments says) loses; one per cent, of its weight in 50 years, and silver one per cent, in 10 years. In this country the less on gold coins through wear and tear is estimated by the. deputy-master of the Mint to average £48,000 a year. Mr. Miller, after careful investigation, found that 100 sovereigns lost £3 9s. 8d. in 100 years, or 8 1/2d. per annum on every £100. A hundred pounds worth of shillings wears to the extent of nearly £37 in the 100 years, while the same value of copper coins depreciate 50 per cent., and would only be worth £50 at the end of the 100th year. It has been proved by experiment that the average loss of weight in worn sovereigns and half-sovereigns now in circulation is about 3d. in each sovereign; the deficiency in fineness of a ¡ large proportion of the coin amounts to about £400 per million. £31,000,000 of our gold coinage is believed to be light. If a gold coin is three grains under the standard weight it is held that the deterioration has been caused otherwise than by fair wear and tear. Coins with less deterioration are paid in full. France holds a much larger amount of gold in reserve than any other country in the world. In 1889 France held 101 millions in bullion out of the 294 millions held by all the countries in Europe. Mulhall gives the list of those countries holding in reserve more than nine millions in specie as follows: Millions. £ 		Millions.  £
 France ........101 	Australasia.....19.3
 Germany ........59 	Italy...........14
 United States...34 	India...........12
 Russia..........33	Holland.........10.6
 United Kingdom..28	Spain............9.5
 Austria.........21.5     

It will be observed that among the above England stands the fifth on the list. This may be accounted for in two ways. First, because there is no issue of notes under the value of £5, which necessitates an immense quantity of gold being kept in circulation. Secondly, the commerce of Great Britain with some countries being so enormous and its lending powers so great, a perpetual drain is the inevitable results. Russia, Italy, and Spain have little or no financial influence. They are constant borrowers from more wealthy nations, but lenders never.
