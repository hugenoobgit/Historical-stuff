THE AMERICAN IRISH FAMINE FUND. THREATENED COLLAPSE. 
The American committee for the relief of the famine in Ireland have. according to a Dalziel telegram from New York, decided, before making any further appeal to the public for funds, to await the report of a special agent who has been sent to Ireland in order that the Impoverished condition of the people may be proved so clearly that the public will be completely convinced of the necessity of supplying funds. That agent is now on his way, and is expected to make a full report very soon with respect to the actual state of the country. The chief Western papers, regardless of party, are asking people to take an interest in the scheme, and are trying to get the smaller country papers to advocate the fund and collect money from the people of the country districts. As yet, however, little progress has been made, and the whole movement is in danger of collapsing. The Rev. Dr. John Hall, one of the most prominent clergymen in New York, and an Irishman by birth, violently opposes the fund, publicly and privately, and through his influence Mr. Eliot F. Shepard, one of the leading members of the committee, has withdrawn his name, and now attacks the fund. The committee have opened their headquarters in the New York Times building. Thus far, only from 200 to 250 persons have subscribed, and the amounts given in each instance are very small. The committee are unquestionably very much chagrined at the poor success of the appeal, but excuse the small results by saying that no canvassing has been done. The American Committee announce that they are not connected with the Home Rule or any other movement.
