CURE FOR SMOKING 
Mr. O. Clayton Jones, writing from Silvertown to the Lancet," gives a remarkable "cure" for excessive cigarette smoking by lads. He says: To break the cigarette habit in a youth there is nothing better than peppermint drops. He cannot smoke with a "bullâ€™s-eye' in his mouth, and even for some time after it is dissolved tobacco will not blend kindly with the taste that remains. Socially the cure may seem worse than the disease, but from a medical point of view the sucking of peppermints is far less hurtful. A common bull's-eye will prevent smoking for nearly an hour, so the amount of sweets used need not be great. It would be a good plan to insist upon, the youth who will smoke making his own cigarettes without the aid of a machine. Few will smoke to excess if they have to make their own cigarettes.
